Self-taught and aspiring Full Stack Dev.

## My Favorite Project
[Better Reads v2](https://github.com/zach-monroe/betterReadsv2)

#### Summary:
A full-stack booknotes web-app with a twist.
Users can create their own compendium in animated notebooks [inspired by famous author Ryan Holliday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT1EExZkzMM).

#### Features:
- Users can create unique profiles and posts about their favorite books. (These posts are called "Reads" and users have CRUD functionality)
- Users can add "highlights" to their Reads, which render in an animated flipbook others can access. Users can edit their flipbooks and add new entries.

Checkout the repo (linked above) for more information.
